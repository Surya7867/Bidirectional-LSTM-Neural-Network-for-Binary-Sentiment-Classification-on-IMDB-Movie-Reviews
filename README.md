# Bidirectional-LSTM-Neural-Network-for-Binary-Sentiment-Classification-on-IMDB-Movie-Reviews
This project implements a deep learning solution to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as either positive or negative. The system uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to analyze textual sentiment with 88-90% accuracy.
